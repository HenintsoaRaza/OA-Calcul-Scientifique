# OA-Calcul-Scientifique


This repository contains all the Homeworks submitted for the *Numerical Analysis* course at ECE Paris. All of the algorithms have been programmed from scratch. The course is divided into 2 parts: on one hand the *numerical optimization* part, and on the other hand the *numerical methods*.

The authors of this work are :

- James WANG
- Henintsoa RAZAFINDRAZAKA



For the *Numerical Optimisation* part, the themes of each Homework is summarized in this list:

1. Homework 1: **Direct Methods for solving Linear Systems (matrix triangulation, Gauss method, LU algorithm)**
2. Homework 2: **Iterative Methods for solving Linear Systems (Gauss-Seidel algorithm) **
3. Homework 3: **Polynomial interpolation (Lagrange polynomial, Runge's phenomenon)**
4. Homework 4: **Numerical integration (Trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule)**



For the *Numerical Methods* part, here are the themes of each Homework:

1. Homework 1: **The Black-Sholes model**
2. Homework 2: **Heat equation model**
